Git

Git is...

* a content addressable database
* and a version control system
* The version control system uses the database

The database

* Most databases are location addressable: you store data in a location
* Git's database is a content addressable database, you put content in and it gives you back a fingerprint or hash.
* If you change a single piece of that content you get a new unique hash.
* All of the content you put into Git is called a repository
* When you put some Raw content into a repository it is called a blob
* A blob is just the contents of a file. It's doesn't contain any metadata: information about what the file is called and where it lives and what's changed
* A record of information about files, the Git database can store a treee
* A tree represents a folder; it collects together all the metadata about the blobs of raw data
